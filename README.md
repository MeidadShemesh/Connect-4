# Connect 4 (C Console Game)

I made a version of Connect 4 that runs in a terminal. It is written in C. I made this project as part of my first semester at the Holon Institute of Technology.

### Features

* **Game Modes:** Player vs Player & Player vs Computer.

* **AI Difficulty:** Includes Easy, Medium, and Hard.

* **Stats Tracking:** The game keeps track of the number of wins the number of losses and the number of draws and it saves all of these stats to a file.

* **Input Validation:** Robust handling to prevent crashes from invalid keys.

*This project marks the start of my GitHub journey to document my progress in Computer Science.*
